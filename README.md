Hi, I’m @cswartzell
I’m interested in restarting my CS education to change careers.
I’m currently learning Python, and C# for Unity Development.
I’m not looking to collaborate on anyhing at the moment, but may be interested in some board game implementations in Unity, or VR apps as well. 

Feel free to contact me at cswartzell@gmail.com
