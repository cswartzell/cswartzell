Hi, I’m @cswartzell
I’m interested in restarting my CS education to change careers
I’m currently learning Python, and C# for Unity Development
I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but possibly some board game implementations in Unity. Possibly VR apps as well
How to reach me ... cswartzell@gmail.com
